# Sliced Views

This sample demonstrates the alternative 9-sliced prefabs for the built in views.
Sliced views use 9-sliced sprites to create resizeable dialogue views with custom texture backgrounds.
These views are made using the default line view and options list view and have no custom code inside of them and are provided as alternative prefabs for dialogue UI.

This sample highlights:

- using the alternative prefabs to create customisable UI
- using multiple sprites and highlight states to customise UI

To get started play the scene and the dialogue will start itself.
Click on the small arrow to advance lines and click on option bubbles to select a choice.
