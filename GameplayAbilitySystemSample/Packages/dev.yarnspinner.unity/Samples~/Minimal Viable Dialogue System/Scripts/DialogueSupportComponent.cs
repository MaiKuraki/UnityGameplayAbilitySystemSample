// This class exists to provide some support structure for the minimal dialogue system, it does two things:
// 1. gives a means to start the dialogue
// 2. "handles" commands in the dialogue
// It does these in a very basic manner, just calling start on the runner and logging the commands
// and is not designed to be a full solution for either of these, just something to make the sample work.
