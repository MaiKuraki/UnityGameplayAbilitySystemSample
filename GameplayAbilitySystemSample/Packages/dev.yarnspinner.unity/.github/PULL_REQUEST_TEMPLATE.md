Ideas:

- Performance?
  - Does this drastically change performance characteristics, or simply allow for optimizations?
  - Does this performance involve:
    - Disk access
    - CPU time
    - Memory layout optimization (Lx caching etc)
  - Might there be a use case where you are encouraged to be unperformant by default?
  - What optimizations did you consider but left out due to time and/or complexity?
- Usability?
  - If your change is to a sample, is it accessible? We don't follow standards like WCAG but any easy wins should be taken.
  - Does it make it easier to use our API? If not, what annoyance mitigations have you taken/considered?
- Who will be affected?
  - Is this an internal change, or something meant to be consumed by the end user?
  - If you add API changes, is it easily upgradable from the previous version?
  - What indirect consequence might be annoying to the end user?
    - For what reasons would you say this is justified? E.g. super annoying to use in the first place, tightening up undefined behavior etc.
- What do you think will be controversial, if any?
- How would you describe the cause of the problem and changes to non-technical users if at all possible?

Feel free to take any all or none of these points as relevant, though we recommend you read through each point. They're just to get you started!
